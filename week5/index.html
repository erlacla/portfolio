<ul>
<li>target = element that triggered event<br> currentTarget = element that has the event listener.</li>
<li>To flatten an array means to take remove the nesting brackets from an array.</li>
<li>Use strict = must declare variable properly. Will show errors for sloppiness. 'use strict';</li>
<li>Should probably start any project with just the root files: index.html , main.js, and main.css.</li>
<li>"User errors are in fact also programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way that prevents the user from making the error."</li>
<li>Stack trace = goes function by function to get to error.</li>
<li>Warning = a error but not enough to make the program crash.</li>
<li>It's good for errors to be loud. "Failing silently makes errors difficult to spot and longer to track down."</li>
<li>Linting = helps find js errors or sloppy programming.</li>
<li>"Passing a lint test is no guarantee that your code is correct, but it will mean it will be more consistent and less likely to have problems."</li>
<li>Determine browser support for a feature with feature detection.</li>
<li>Use breakpoints to debug or use alerts or the console</li>
<li>"ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn’t exist. For example, calling a function that hasn't been defined."</li>
<li>"TypeError is thrown when there’s an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when a number is expected."</li>
<li>You can make your own error message with 'throw'</li>
<li>Use catch, try, and finally to see if the code runs properly.</li>
<li>Boolean tests help keep code solid, not brittle.</li>
<li>TDD = test-driven development. Write tests first, then code, then refractor. Test every time.</li>
<li>You can use a jest -c {} (Jest framework) test to mock try a function to see if it PASS or FAIL</li>
