        This week I finalized my madlib story, I worked on a gallery, and added a API for the astronomy picture of the
        day. It works great but.... it makes the my page weight jump up to 3.9 MB!! Not good. So, maybe I'll just put a
        link to the page instead of using the API. Do you have a preference? I also learned that if you want a
        transparent background you can't have a jpg.
