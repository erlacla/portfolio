        <ul>
            <li>transform: translate(45px, -45px);  kinda like using position: relative. Moves an <span id="scale">element</span> x from the left, and y from the top:</li>
            <li>scale: scale(1) would leave the element the same size, scale(2) would double its proportions, scale(0.5) would halve them, and so on. Providing different values will distort the element, as you’d expect: transform: scale(1.5, 0.25);</li>
            <li>Don't declare more than 1 transform. It will override the first.</li>
            <li>Translation has no impact on the document flow</li>
            <li>Skew: uses the x and y axis too. Try <span id="skew">me</span>.</li>
            <li>The order of transform functions makes a difference. If you rotate before translating, your translate direction will be on the rotated axis</li>
            <li>Transition-duration property: 0.2 seconds ( 0.2s ), or 200 milliseconds ( 200ms )   transition-duration: 0.2s;</li>
            <li>200ms is generally considered the optimum time for a transition: anything slower will make the website seem slow</li>
            <li>Negative time delay: start partway through the animation. </li>
            <li>h1 span {
                transition: transform 0.2s ease-out 50ms;
            }</li>
            <li>If a delay is included, you must also include a duration, and the duration must precede the delay.</li>
            <li>When using the all keyword, all the properties transition at the same rate, speed, and delay:

                transition: all 0.2s ease-out 50ms;</li>
            <li>@keyframes animation: first attach to element.</li>
            <li>There are two keyterms― from and to ―which evaluate to 0% and 100% respectively. These values specify how far along the animation each keyframe is located.</li>
            <li>Animation-name: Do not use key terms such as forwards , running , or alternate for the animation name.</li>
            <li>Just because you can animate/transform/etc.., doesn’t mean you should. </li>
