        <ul id="facts">10 Crazy Facts You Didn't Know About Space:
          <li> 1. Space is completely silent

            There is no atmosphere in space, which means that sound has no medium or way to travel to be heard.
          </li>
          <li> 2. The hottest planet in our solar system is 450° c.

            Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system and has an average surface temperature of around 450° c. Did
            you know that venus isn't the closest planet to the sun? That is mercury. You would think that mercury would
            then be the hottest, but mercury has no atmosphere (which regulates temperature), resulting in big
            fluctuations.
          </li>
          <li> 3. A full nasa space suit costs $12,000,000.

            While the entire suit costs a cool $12m, 70% of that cost is for the backpack and control module. However,
            the
            space suits that nasa uses were built in 1974. If these were priced by today's pricing, they would cost an
            estimated 150 million dollars!
          </li>
          <li> 4. The sun’s mass takes up 99.86% of the solar system.

            The sun accounts for 99.86% of the mass in our solar system with a mass of around 330,000 times that of
            earth.
            Did you know that the sun is made up of mostly hydrogen (three quarters worth) with the rest of its mass
            attributed to helium. If the sun had a voice would it be high and squeaky from all that helium?
          </li>
          <li> 5. One million earths can fit inside the sun

            The sun is large enough that approximately 1.3 million earths could fit inside (if squashed in) or if the
            earths retained their spherical shape then 960,000 would fit. But can you visualise that number of earths?
          </li>
          <li> 6. There are more trees on earth than stars in the milky way

            There are about three trillion trees on planet earth, and between 100-400 billion stars, approximately, in
            the
            galaxy.
          </li>
          <li> 7. The sunset on mars appears blue
            Just as colors are made more dramatic in sunsets on earth, sunsets on mars, according to nasa, would appear
            bluish to human observers watching from the red planet. Fine dust makes the blue near the sun's part of the
            sky much more visibilke, while normal daylight makes the red planet's familiar rusty dust color the most
            perceptible to the human eye.
          </li>
          <li> 8. There are more stars in the universe than grains of sands on earth
            The universe extends far beyond our own galaxy, the milky way, which is why scientists can only estimate how
            many stars are in space. However, scientists estimate the universe contains approximately
            1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 stars, or a septillion. While no one can actually count every single grain
            of sand on the earth, the estimated total from researchers at the university of hawaii, is somewhere around
            seven quintillion, five hundred quadrillion grains. That is an awfully big sand castle!
          </li>
          <li> 9. One day on venus is longer than one year.
            Venus has a slow axis rotation which takes 243 earth days to complete its day. The orbit of venus around the
            sun is 225 earth days, making a year on venus 18 days less than a day on venus.
          </li>
          <li> 10. There is a planet made of diamonds
            There’s a planet made of diamonds twice the size of earth the "super earth," aka 55 cancri e, is most likely
            covered in graphite and diamond. Paying a visit to that planet would probably pay for the $12 million dollar
            space suit needed to get there!
          </li>
