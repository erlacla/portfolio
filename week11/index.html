      <li>Notes about my learning: <br>
        I know I am learning a lot but I am not sure if I'm at the level I'm expected to be at. I still
        open the instructor's solution and initially feel intimidated by the code inside. As I read
        through it carefully, I can understand 90% of what's going on, but I still have yet to figure out the
        answers on my own. I do try very hard though, which is disheartening. I'm not sure if that's to be expected,
        or if I'm really not on track. Even working together with my team we, we can't get the activity finished.
        It's hard, but I keep telling myself the best learning is in the struggle, right?</li>
      <li>Authentication: <br>
        I was able to get both servers going. I got all the way to the end of step 2 where I needed to finish
        writing the login function code. Thats where I got stuck. I worked on it with my team and Aaron realized
        we needed to create a new instance of the Auth class before it would work. I had a difficult time with
        this assignment because it wasn't clear in my head what it was supposed to do. I didn't know if I
        was supposed to create a new user name and password, or if I was just supposed to use user1@email.com
        for this exercise. After a few hours of try and fail, I opened the solution. I have a hard time knowing
        when a piece of code is a variable or a keyword. I'm sure over time I'll learn what all the keywords are.
        Maybe if I change the colors on VScode that would help me differentiate.
        The first time I went back to the code to work again on it, it wouldn't work, but then I realized I needed
        to start the npm run start-auth again. Then it worked. I did a little css too.</li>
      <li>Solar MadLib Project: <br>
        I got a good start on my MadLib project. I was trying to decide the best way to display the MadLib...
        Should I do innerHTML through Javascript? Should I display it on a different page or do AJAX somehow on
        the same page as the form? I guess I'll try one way and then change if I have to later. Any direction you
        have for me is appreciated.</li>
