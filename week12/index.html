        <ul>
            <li> What did I do since the last meeting? I did a lot of work on my solar madLib project. I got some good
                practice passing the json data from the API around.</li>
            <li> What am I going to do next? I want to keep improving my madLib, build a cool solar system gallery page,
                look into the frontend standards and make sure everything is up to par, and make an additional madLib
                story.</li>
            <li> What are my blockers? Right now I'm stuck on submitting the form, opening the display page, and passing
                the data from the form and the json data into the madLib to display. When I click the submit button, the
                madLib doesn't display and I get the error message: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property
                'addEventListener' of null. I know I'll figure it out... </li>
